# WritingBeautifulRESTfulAPIs
 
### Instructor
Ethan Ballinger

### Description
RESTful APIs are part of our everyday life and most may not even know it. Because most of the design and implementation of these APIs is left up to developers and architects, there are a wide array of opinions and ideas on how things should work. This can create a good deal of confusion.  
  
Writing Beautiful RESTful APIs provides a fundamental overview of REST, best practices for design, and discusses several advanced topics like pagination, search, and authentication.  
  
This course is meant for beginners to API design, but it is also a good refresher for those who are familiar to API design or are hoping to gain a deeper understanding of advanced topics.  
  
By the end of the course, you will understand the fundamentals of REST and you'll be able to start designing your APIs to be "beautiful APIs".
